This app will show you who is following you on GitHub. If you're curious who someone is, just follow the link to checkout their GitHub profile.

When you enter a GitHub username, the app will randomly choose whether to query GitHub's REST or GraphQL API. In either case it returns a grid of the users that follow the user you searched for.

The GraphQL API seems to be about 3x faster for this use case.
